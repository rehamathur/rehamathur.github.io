## About Me

I am currently a senior at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/), majoring in Chemical and Biological Engineering, with certificates in both Computer Science and Statistics and Machine Learning.

Right now, I am an ML intern at [DE Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com/), working on the development of diffusion models to predict the presence of buried waters within proteins. Additionally, I am doing my senior thesis with the [Rabinowitz Group](https://rabinowitz.scholar.princeton.edu/). The focus of my research is performing metabolic flux analysis on a whole-body mouse metabolism. Moreover, I am intern on the biotech investments team at [Lux Capital](https://www.luxcapital.com/).

In the past, I have also worked at [DE Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com/) as part of the force fields team. My work there involved the improvement of free energy perturbation methodology by incorporating the effects of protomers and tautomers. Furthermore, I worked with the [Panagiotopoulos Group](https://azpgroup.scholar.princeton.edu/), where my focus was on developing a machine learning potential for carbon dioxide.
## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning:**  generative models, de novo protein design
- **Molecular Dynamics:**  force field development, free energy perturbation
- **Metabolomics:** metabolic flux analysis, flux balance analysis, fluxonomics
