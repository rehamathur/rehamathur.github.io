## About Me

I am a senior at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) studying Chemical and Biological Engineering with certificates in Computer Science and Statistics and Machine Learning. 

Currently, I am a ML intern at [DE Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com/) working on developing diffusion models for predicting buried waters within proteins. I am also doing my senior thesis in the [Rabinowitz Group](https://rabinowitz.scholar.princeton.edu/) on performing metabolic flux analysis on a whole-body mouse metabolism. I am working on the biotech investments team at [Lux Capital](https://www.luxcapital.com/).

Previously I worked at [DE Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com/) in the force fields team working on improving free energy perturbation methodology by incorporating the effects of protomers and tautomers. I also worked with the [Panagiotopoulos Group](https://azpgroup.scholar.princeton.edu/) developing a machine learning potential for carbon dioxide. 
## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning:**  generative models, de novo protein design
- **Molecular Dynamics:**  force field development, free energy perturbation
- **Metabolomics:** metabolic flux analysis, flux balance analysis, fluxonomics
