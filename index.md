## About Me

I am currently a senior at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/), majoring in Chemical and Biological Engineering, with certificates in both Computer Science and Statistics and Machine Learning.

Right now I am a product management intern at [Enveda Biosciences](https://www.envedabio.com). Additionally, I am doing my senior thesis with the [Rabinowitz Group](https://rabinowitz.scholar.princeton.edu/). The focus of my research is performing metabolic flux analysis on a whole-body mouse metabolism. 

In the past I was an intern on the biotech investments team at [Lux Capital](https://www.luxcapital.com/). I have also worked at [DE Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com/) as part of the force fields team and the machine learning team.  My work there involved the improvement of free energy perturbation methodology by incorporating the effects of protomers and tautomers and developing a generative diffusino model to place internal waters within a protein structure. Furthermore, I worked with the [Panagiotopoulos Group](https://azpgroup.scholar.princeton.edu/), where my focus was on developing a machine learning potential for carbon dioxide.
## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning:**  generative models, de novo protein design
- **Molecular Dynamics:**  force field development, free energy perturbation
- **Metabolomics:** metabolic flux analysis, flux balance analysis, fluxonomics
