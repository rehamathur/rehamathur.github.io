## About Me

I am currently an investor at [Dimension Capital](https://www.dimensioncap.com/), a life sciences venture capital fund focused on companies at the intersection of computation and biology. 


I graduated from [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/), majoring in Chemical and Biological Engineering, with a certificate in Statistics and Machine Learning.
In the past, I was a product management intern at [Enveda Biosciences](https://www.envedabio.com). Additionally, I completed my senior thesis with the [Rabinowitz Group](https://rabinowitz.scholar.princeton.edu/) where I developed IDFlux, a highly scalable metabolic flux analysis tool, which I used to quantifying fluxes on the whole-body scale of a mouse. I also was an intern on the biotech investments team at [Lux Capital](https://www.luxcapital.com/). I worked at [DE Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com/) as part of the force fields team and the machine learning team.  My work there involved the improvement of free energy perturbation methodology by incorporating the effects of protomers and tautomers and developing a generative diffusion model to place internal waters within a protein structure. Finally, I worked with the [Panagiotopoulos Group](https://azpgroup.scholar.princeton.edu/), where my focus was on developing a neural net potential for carbon dioxide.
## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning:**  generative models, de novo protein design
- **Molecular Dynamics:**  force field development, free energy perturbation
